# Travel Indonesia: A Landing Page built in ReactJS

A beautiful landing page of **Indonesian favourite destination** built with **ReactJS** with an interactive **Framer Motion** and  **Embla Slider**.
I design it myself with the help of many template on internet as inspiration. All 'visual' data can be easily modified by changing the .json file in **constants** folder.
